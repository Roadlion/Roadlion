# 👋 Hey hey people, Lion here.

Welcome to my GitHub.

I'm currently studying **Financial Engineering** — not because I love it, but because it pays the bills. This page is where I document my *real* mission: **getting my shit together and becoming a code wizard who builds cool stuff**.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Really About

My true passions lie in **building, creating, and experimenting**. Here's what gets me fired up:

- 🤖 Robotics  
- 🎭 Cosplay (especially making props and armor)  
- 🖨️ 3D Printing  
- 🧪 Making cool, chaotic projects like [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves)  
- 🎬 Filming & Editing Videos  
- 🎮 Game Development & Game Design  
- 🧊 3D Modeling (mostly in Blender — 300+ hrs in)  
- 🎨 Miniature Painting & Custom Models  

Basically, I like **turning imagination into reality**. That’s real engineering — the kind they *should* teach in schools.

## 💻 What You'll Find Here

This GitHub is my personal lab and digital playground. Expect:

- Robotics experiments (motion capture, control systems, custom builds)  
- 3D-printed project files and prop builds  
- Python scripts for finance, optimization, and AI  
- Game prototypes and dev logs  
- My journey learning coding from scratch and (eventually) kicking ass at it  

I don’t pretend to be perfect — but I do get a little better every week.

## 🌍 Languages I Speak

- 🇹🇭 Thai (native)  
- 🇺🇸 English (fluent)  
- 🇨🇳 Mandarin (enough to survive, barely)  
- 🇪🇸 🇫🇷 🇩🇪 🇮🇩 🇯🇵 Trace amounts of other languages  

I'm basically the world's most **mid polyglot**, but I try.

## ⚔️ Fun Facts About Me

1. ☕ I only drink **espresso**. Everything else is not "real" coffee.  
2. 🥊 I box and train Muay Thai. Working on my **Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu** next.  
3. 🧩 I consider my **autism a superpower**. I plan on using it to get a Master’s in **Robotics**, where I can finally study something I love.

## 🚀 Goals for the Next 2 Years

- Build a robotics-focused portfolio from scratch  
- Make weird but awesome YouTube videos documenting my projects  
- Earn enough money to support my hobby addictions  
- Apply for a Robotics Master’s and **actually enjoy what I study** for once  
- Prove that even a financial engineering student can become a maker/engineer if they're stubborn enough
